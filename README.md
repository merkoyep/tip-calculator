# About

This project was created with the goal for me to get familiar with React fundamentals such as utilizing useState and passing properties to components.

Additionally, I wanted to explore designing web applications using vanilla CSS and explore concepts of visual web design. In this project, I utilized google fonts to import a typeface externally, and played around with contrasting colours to create dimension.
